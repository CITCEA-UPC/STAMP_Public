This repository presents the Small-Signal Toolbox for Analysis of Modern Power systems (STAMP), a Matlab-based toolbox for automatic EMT modeling and SSA of hybrid AC/DC power systems. STAMP was developed in the CITCEA-UPC research center of Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

It is recommended to have MATLAB R2023b or any more recent version installed. Simulink, SimPowerSystems, the Signal Processing Toolbox and the DSP System Toolbox are necessary for the SSA and TDS features of the toolbox.
